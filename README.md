Climate shocks such as floods impose sudden and disruptive constraints on firms, 
damaging capital, interrupting production, and displacing workers. 
Although a growing literature shows that extreme weather and natural disasters reduce 
industrial output, far less is known about how human capital shapes these impacts.  Skilled workers offer greater adaptive capacity through problem-solving, task flexibility, and technology use, but there is little quantitative evidence on whether a higher skilled-labour share actually mitigates firms’ vulnerability to climate shocks.

This paper will explore how climate shocks affect firm-level productivity in Vietnam and to what extent do workforce skill and experience shape firms' immediate losses, production technology responses and subsequent recovery.

This yields four sub-questions:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Magnitude of Impact:} What is the effect of floods on firm productivity (TFP)?
    \item \textbf{Skill Heterogeneity:} Do firms with a higher share of skilled workers experience smaller productivity losses?
    \item \textbf{Dynamic Recovery:} Do firms with higher proportions of skilled workforce recover productivity faster after a flood? 
    \item \textbf{Technology Change:} Do floods alter firms’ production technology (capital and labour elasticities)?
\end{enumerate}
